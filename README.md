# 🚢 AI Agentic Supply Chain System

## 📄 Project Overview
The **AI Agentic Supply Chain System** is designed to **streamline international shipping operations and contract management** by leveraging **AI-driven agents, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, MongoDB Atlas, and Large Language Models (LLMs)**. This intelligent system enhances contract management, optimizes supply chain workflows, and improves customer service for global shipping companies.

This project is based on the original implementation from [MongoDB Developer GenAI Showcase](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/GenAI-Showcase/blob/main/partners/gravity9/Agentic_System_Enhanced_Contract_and_Supply_Chain_Management_for_International_Shipping.ipynb), where additional features such as **Streamlit-based UI** have been incorporated for an enhanced user experience.

## 🎯 Objective
- Automate supply chain and contract management using AI-driven assistants.
- Provide **real-time shipment updates** and contract insights.
- Improve efficiency, reduce operational delays, and enhance **customer service**.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- 🔎 **Retrieve Contract & Shipment Data** – Search MongoDB-stored contracts, inventory, and routing details.
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Queries** – Use **LLMs + RAG architecture** for natural language interactions.
- 🌐 **Streamlit UI** – Interactive web interface for users to interact with the system easily.
- 📊 **Real-Time Shipment Updates** – Modify shipment statuses and notify stakeholders instantly.
- 🚀 **Hybrid Search Capabilities** – Perform **vector + full-text searches** for contract and inventory data.
- 📈 **Actionable Insights** – Generate insights for supply chain optimization and compliance.

## 🏗️ Solution Overview
International shipping contracts contain detailed clauses covering **tariffs, insurance, delivery timelines, and penalties**. This AI-powered system enables **operations, legal, and supply chain teams** to access accurate contract details quickly. 

### 🔹 **AI Agent Capabilities**
1. **Retrieve Relevant Data** – Searches **MongoDB Atlas** for contract terms, shipment records, inventory levels, and supplier agreements.
2. **Generate Natural Language Responses** – Converts complex legal terms and logistics data into simple answers for non-technical users.
3. **Update Shipment Statuses** – Modifies shipment details, logs delays, and notifies impacted teams.
4. **Streamlit Web UI** – Allows users to interact with the AI assistant through a simple web interface.

## 🏢 Use Case Examples
- 📦 **Operations Management**: "What penalties apply for shipment delays on the Asia-Europe route?"
- 🏛️ **Legal & Compliance**: "What are the customs requirements for shipping electronics to Canada?"
- 🚛 **Supply Chain Optimization**: "What inventory is in transit to Europe, and are there delays?"
- 🤝 **Supplier Collaboration**: "What are the penalties if our supplier delays shipment?"
- 🚢 **Shipment Tracking**: "Update Shipment **SHP-2024-001** to 'Delayed' and notify relevant teams."

---

## 🛡️ Security Considerations
- **Role-Based Access Control** – Limit who can update shipment statuses.
- **Data Encryption** – Ensure contract data is stored securely.
- **Audit Logging** – Track all agent interactions for compliance.

## 📈 Monitoring & Logging
- **MongoDB Aggregation Pipelines** – Monitor query trends and usage.
- **Logging Mechanisms** – Keep records of queries and updates for audit trails.
